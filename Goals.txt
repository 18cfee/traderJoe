Machine learning or other to predict most drastic companies as far as short or long:
    - find what vars are included that could be used to build a classifier
        - todo find correlation with vars
            - make a table of all the factors and then normalize and plot over a certain time period. Also plot all the stocks, maybe take the
            log of the actual stock value before normalizing, it is possible that stock will have to be plotted as more of how much it changed
            each day
    todo learn a couple of algorithms that could be used
        neural net?
        Decision tree?
        k-nearest to decide which companies are similar to each other
            then predict how a company will do based on ones it is similar to and how they did in the past
            or just see if one is straying a little from the ones it is similar to and predict that it will eventually
            follow their behavior
        maybe some kind of classification about which companies seem to be good and which bad?

    - use best fit curves to predict

Build a structure for deciding what companies to invest in
    - var for number of companies to invest in at once
    - can more be invested in certain types of companies
    - var for min time to "commit" to an investment
    - var for min benefit prediction to make it worth switching (after commit time is over)
    - maybe force a change in position after a certain amount of time so that I could not be dQd. rule 7.s
    - reAllocating variable

Would be interesting to make a list of the most volatile companies?
    - design and implement a volatility metric for stocks

Read the rules and really understand the competition a little better
    - read through the rules again before comp
    todo what is the sharpe ratio exactly?
    todo make a submission
    - does the software version really matter as long as it runs?
    - Make sure to really understand slippage
    - what happens if a position is not specified (is previous day kept)?
    - what is meant by annualized volatility?
    - what is the difference between a stock and future
    - how much data can be stored in the

General Tech Stuff To Take Care of
    todo finish .gitignore
    - make a script to easily visualize some data
        histogram
        x-y plot
