Machine learning or other to predict most drastic companies as far as short or long:
    - find what vars are included that could be used to build a classifier
        the rules seems to not say anything more than the close each day
    todo learn a couple of algorithms that could be used
    - use best fit curves to predict

Build a structure for deciding what companies to invest in
    - var for number of companies to invest in at once
    - var for min time to "commit" to an investment
    - var for min benefit prediction to make it worth switching (after commit time is over)
    - maybe force a change in position after a certain amount of time so that I could not be dQd. rule 7.s

Would be interesting to make a list of the most volatile companies?
    - design and implement a volatility metric for stocks

Read the rules and really understand the competition a little better
    - read through the rules again before comp
    todo what is the sharpe ratio exactly?
    todo make a submission
    - does the software version really matter as long as it runs?
    - Make sure to really understand slippage
    - what happens if a position is not specified (is previous day kept)?
    - what is meant by annualized volatility?
    - what is the difference between a stock and future

General Tech Stuff To Take Care of
    todo finish .gitignore
    - make a script to easily visualize some data
